# RfP-Countdown
 
 Almost same as [RfP-discord_webhook](https://github.com/smaartscz/RfP-discord_webhook) but this time in python.

 ## How does it work?
 Every day at specified time this script will send message to Discord.

 # Web interface
⚠Be careful⚠
Web interface will expose your Discord webhook! If this Web UI is openly accessible then bad actor can abuse it to send custom messages on your server.

If you want to have this UI available on internet make sure to protect it via custom auth provider or IP filtering.
